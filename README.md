# ACD Portfolio
## Description
For this project, I created a portfolio page to share my deployed applications and function as a digital resume. This project is a work-in-progress and will be updated as my skills grow. This application demonstrates my skills with semantic html, flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, and responsive web design.
